// class : class is a container which is used to hold all the members of 
the class like methods, variables, blicks, objects etc. it is used to 
group together all the members of a class. it is used implement the
concept of Encapsulation.

// public : it is an access modifier/specifier which grants permission 
to use its member by any class inside the same folder and also from outside folder.

// static : static keyword is used to enable a member of a class to not 
get duplicated by the objects.
because static members are not part of any object. So, they can be 
accessed directly by any other class.
	static members can be accessed by static members only.

// void : it is a return type of a method. when a method does not return
any volue, then we use void.

//main : main is the main method of a class/project. it is the first 
mehod which the compiler fethes to start your program.

//String : String is an inbuilt class of java. All the classes of java 
are reffered as Non-primitive datatype.

//args[] : it is a single dimension array of String type. which is used 
for storing command line arguments.

//These two methods are used to print messages, output values of 
variables on the console screan.

// System.out.println(); : println() prints the message/variable and 
puts \n(nextline) after that

// System.out.print();   : print() prints the message/variables
without nextline
